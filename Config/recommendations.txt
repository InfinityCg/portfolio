Siddharth played an integral role in visualizing some of the ship’s most important spaces, including the main hall, buffet hall, conference room, bar, and dining hall. From the outset, Siddharth demonstrated a keen understanding of our design vision and translated our concepts into compelling, detailed visualizations that captured both the spirit of Polynesian hospitality and the modern functionality we required. The quality of their work significantly contributed to helping stakeholders, contractors, and our executive team better envision the final spaces, leading to more efficient decision-making and project alignment.

Siddharth worked with us on designing a temple within the premises of Sunshine BirdWorld, Bengaluru. With only the carpet area provided, he took complete initiative—researching local culture, planning the architecture, and delivering beautifully detailed renders. His attention to dimension, design, and cultural sensitivity brought the vision to life. A dedicated and creative designer!
