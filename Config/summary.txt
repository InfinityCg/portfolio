What started as a hobby, has now culminated into a spectecular career. With over 4 years of experience of working in the field of 3D art, I currently work as a 3D generalist. My area of expertise include a wide range of skills including 3D modelling, Texturing and animation, with particular focus on Hardsurface, Product modelling, Archviz, Prop and inorganic animations. 
I strive hard to make every single piece iconic. I continue to learn new skills and keep up with the changes in this space, hoping to provide the best outcome for my clients.
