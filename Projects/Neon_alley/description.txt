Japanese alley
---
Heavily inspired from the Japanese alley(s) and the neon culture, The idea was to make only an empty alley but later the cat was added as the subject of focus.
This a a piece that I have been building little by little from the start of feb.
I created most of the scene assets myself but use some CC0 assets as well, sort of 70:30.
Whole process was done in blender and rendered with Cycles with some post-processing in photoshop
Hope you like it!
